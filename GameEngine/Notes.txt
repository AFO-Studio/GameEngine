Smaller versions of a texture used instead of the full version when we get farther away from a texture

Sampler States
	Filter Modes - Determine Quality of a texture
		Point, Bilinear, Trilinear, Anisotropic
	Address Modes - Determine what happens with UVs that are outside of the 0-1 range
		Wrap - Tile or Repeat an image
		Clamp - Restrict value outside of 0-1 to 0-1 (so -5, -67 become 0, 1, 100, 100000 become 1)
				Uses the last edge pixel forever
		Border - use a fill color outside of 0-1
		Mirror - Alternate between flipping the uvs as it goes
				So 0-1 gives you 0-1, 1-2 gives you 1-0, 2-3 gives you 0-1 again, and so on.

Textures
All images are textures, but textures don't have to be images
A texture is just a 2D or 3D array of data
	Ex. A 2D array of Pixels is an image or picture (raster image)
	A 2D array of Depth values (depth buffer) is a texture that isn't just an image.

Remember also that for a GPU an array of data is called a Buffer
	So textures are stored as buffers just like vertex buffers, constant buffers, etc.

An image could be used just as a sprite (just a 2D rectangle)
Or a texture can be used on a 3D object by wrapping it around the faces of the object

Pixel smallest unit of color 
In a texture that isn't being used as an image, we call those Texels
	All pixels are texels, not all texels are pixels

 The purpose of Textures is to get Per-Pixel detail instead of Per-Vertex detail (like we've used so far)


	//Big 3 vector functions part 2: Dot product
	//The Dot Product between 2 vectors returns a scalar (a single value instead of a vector)
				//Represents the angle between the two vectors
				//If v and x are parallel, dot(v, x) = 1
				//If v is opposite of x, dot (v, x) = -1
				//if v is perpendicular to x, dot(v, x) = 0

	//nDotl lighting (normal dot product light direction)
	//This value is HOW MUCH LIGHT TO APPLY TO THIS PIXEL
	//This is only for a DIRECTIONAL Light
	//Other lights need a few more steps
	//This is DIFFUSE LIGHTING

 Direct X Math...
	There are 2 categories of data types for everything we use.
	For storing data, we use
		XMFLOAT2 (like a sprite's position in 2D)
		XMFLOAT3 (a 3D objects position, scale, etc.)
		XMFLOAT4 (color)
		XMFLOAT4X4 (Transformation matrix, view matrix (camera))

	BUT for operating on data, we use
		XMVECTOR - always 4 floats, even if you only use 2 or 3. They are xyzw, or rgba for color.
		XMMATRIX

	The reason is because XMVECTOR and XMMATRIX are optimized and use a special
	technology called SIMD, or Single Instruction, Multiple Data.
	Basically when you add two XMFLOAT4's, it adds the x values together, then the y, and so on.
	When you add two XMVECTORS, it can do all 4 operations at the same time (like multithreading)!

	So Adding XMVECTORs is 4x faster than adding XMFLOATs***********************************************

	BUT unfortunately, XMVECTOR and XMMATRIX are not as good for plain storage,
	such as for sitting around in a class member variable.
	So we always use XMFLOAT... for member variables, and XMVECTOR/MATRIX for doing math.
	We use XMLoadFloat... and XMStoreFloat to switch between them.

	It's super annoying, I know!
	This is just the kind of thing Engine and Graphics programmers have to deal with.

Common Graphics Issues (Good Exam Terms):
	Aliasing - stair-step/jagged effect on edges and especially surfaces that are diagonal on screen
				caused by the simple fact that pixels are squares and aren't infinitely small
	Anti-Aliasing - techniques to mitigate Aliasing, usually by blurring the jagged edges in some way
	Clipping - when geometry intersects
	z-fighting - when 2+ faces have the same depth value so they 'fight' over which is on top, causing flickering.
	Overdraw is a problem where we change a pixel more than once per draw() - mostly a big issue in transparency (or if you have no depth buffer)

Backface-Culling
	Get rid of or Ignore triangles on the INSIDES of models (not the 'back' of the model that you could see by moving to the other side of it)
	For efficiency, it just ignores half the triangles in a game

Hints for A3
Distance in 2D
(1, 4) (a gameobject at (1, 4) relative to (0, 0))
(2, 7) ((1, 3) relative to the first gameobject)

Any two points can be broken down into a right triangle (even in 3D)

A Vector is NOT the same as a Point in space
	A vector has a magnitude and direction, relative to an arbirtary in point in space
gameObject2.position - gameObject1.position = A vector representing the location of gameObject2
												relative to gameObject1s position
This vector contains the direction from gameObject1 to gameObject2
	And its magnitude is the distance between them.
	So if you move by that vector in 1 frame you will teleport gameObject1 to gameObject2
	Vectors store direction such as:
	right = (1, 0, 0) -> has a magnitude of 1
	up = (0, 1, 0) -> has a magnitude of 1
	diagonal = (1, 1, 0) -> magnitude of 1.41... 
	Magnitude = length of the hypenteuse formed by the vector relative to (0, 0, 0)

	To extract direction from a vector we want to get a vector with the same direction but 
	a magnitude of 1

	To get that we Normalize the vector
	Normalizing a vector - get the same direction but with a magnitude of 1
							gives us a vector on a unit sphere

	NormalizedVec = Vec/Magnitude of Vec
	(1, 1, 0) -> Mag 1.414
	(1/1.141, 1/1.141, 0/1.414) = (.707, .707, 0)

Pythagorean Theorem
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

2D distance = sqrt((y2-y1)^2 + (x2-x1)^2)

3D distance = sqrt((z2-z1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (x2-x1)^2)

//A Raster image is one that is a grid of pixels (so most images are Raster images)
//The rasterizer is part of the rendering pipeline that blends values from each vertex across the pixels they cover
//Rasterizer States let us change how the rasterizer works, like drawing in wireframe or disabling backface culling
//Depth buffer compares the depth of pixels to determine which is drawn on top

//FROM CAMERA.H
//The projection matrix represents how our camera sees the world.
//In other words, is it a perspective or orthographic (2D) view, 
//what is its size and view angle, how far away (and close) can it see

//Here we multiply the view and projection matrix and store the result
//We can do it once per frame here, instead of once per vertex in a vertex shader
//Notice directx requires that we transpose matrices before using them in shaders, for performance reasons.
//transposing just means flipping the rows and columns in the matrix.
